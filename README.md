# R2D2-RadioControl
R2D2 printed and painted in 3D. Thanks to an Arduino nano, sensors and motors he is able to move like the most famous robot in the galaxy.
Original 3D design are from Chaos Tech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4L06uxcRU
I have included the redisegned part I developed to improve the mobility.
Ussing the bluetooth module, and the app I develope using App Inventor (.aia file) you can control R2D2 using the mobile phone.
